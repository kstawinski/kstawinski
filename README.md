### Hi there 👋

**I'm a 18 years old Front-end Developer (only "wannabe" yet). Currently based in Łódź (almost the center of Poland).**

- 🔭  I’m currently working on my **first Progressive Web App** that will help me calculate the working time, earned money and others.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) technology. 
- 📚  I already have some knowledge in `JavaScript`, `Vue.js`, `PHP`, `SQL` and `HTML`, `CSS`. Maybe something else, but I don't remember.
- 📫  Reach me by mail if you need something: [`stawinskidev@gmail.com`](mailto:stawinskidev@gmail.com).
- 🏍️  Fun fact: I'm a motorcyclist! ⚡
