# Hi! üëã
My name is Kacper and I write code in JavaScript language. I use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework on a daily basis, but I like some lighter solutions too, f.e. [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework or writing clear JS code.

I like atypical projects (_to-do list and calculator are not atypicals!_). For learning and understanding how Vue.js works I created mini game [pickcolor.fun](https://pickcolor.fun). My code you can see [here](https://github.com/kstawinski/pickcolor.fun). Recently I got interested creating apps using [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps). My other project that I'm proud of is [picker of Material Design icons](https://github.com/kstawinski/mdicons) - if you will give me some feedback, I will be very pleased! 

I‚Äôm currently based in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. Reach me by e-mail, if you want: [`stawinskidev@gmail.com`](mailto:stawinskidev+github@gmail.com).

**Have a nice day! ‚ù§Ô∏è**
